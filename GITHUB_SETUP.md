## To Push to GitHub

Since this workspace has limited GitHub authentication, you'll need to push this code manually:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (if authenticated)
```bash
gh repo create mylescorpltd/edumyles --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### Option 2: Using SSH (if SSH keys are configured)
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mylescorpltd/edumyles.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
1. Create a new repository at https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `edumyles`
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Follow GitHub's instructions to push existing repository

### Option 4: Download and Push Locally
1. Download this entire workspace as a ZIP
2. Extract it locally
3. Run:
   ```bash
   cd edumyles
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mylescorpltd/edumyles.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
